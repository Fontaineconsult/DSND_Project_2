In problem 6 we need to find the smallest and largest elements in a random array of ints. To find the min and max,
we first assign the first index in the array to two variables, min and max. We then iterate through the list
and update min if the current value is less and max if the current value is greater.

Since we only iterate through the list once, our complexity is O(N)
