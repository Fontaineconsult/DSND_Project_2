Problem 3 is for the most part simply a merge sort. Once sorted we iterate through the sorted list
we alternate appending each iterate into two seperate lists. We return both lists.


Big O for problem 3 is O(n log n) for the merge sort where N is the size of the input array.
Space complexity is O(N) for the size of the input array.
